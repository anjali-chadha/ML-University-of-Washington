Since most words occur in only a few reviews, word count vectors are sparse. For this reason, scikit-learn and many other tools use sparse matrices to store a collection of word count vectors. Refer to appropriate manuals to produce sparse word count vectors. General steps for extracting word count vectors are as follows:\n",
